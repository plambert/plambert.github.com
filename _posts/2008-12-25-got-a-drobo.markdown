# I got a [Drobo][drobo]!

  [drobo]: http://drobo.com "Data Robotics Inc"

Rachel got me a [Drobo][drobo] for Christmas!  I'm very excited.  If you don't know what they are, they're an external 
RAID-like USB/Firewire storage device.

Or, as Rachel describes it, "Some kind of expensive computer thingy that makes husbands _really_ happy."  :-)
