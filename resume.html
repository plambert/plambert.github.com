      Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a UNIX Systems Architect who has built web server platforms at Yahoo to handle
      loads that make 5,000 requests per second into background noise, beaten untested, 
      consumer-focused operating systems into high-performance enterprise servers, and
      automated entire network operations centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, I bring talented web software developers face to face with the laws of physics,
      and show them how to plan and embrace the chaos that hundreds of millions of users bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I basically want to work with amazing people who teach me, and challenge me to make my own job unnecessary.
